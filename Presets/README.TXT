Developers: commit here your presets using your own dsp scripts (please commit them as well) or the ones included in the plug-in.
Users: copy these presets to your custom presets directory (Documents/Blue Cat Audio/ Blue Cat's Plug'n Script/Presets). corresponding DSP scripts have to be copied to the Scripts directory too.
