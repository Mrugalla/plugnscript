Blue Cat's Plug'n Script Scripts Repository
===========

Repository for audio and MIDI processing scripts and custom user interfaces to be used with [Blue Cat's Plug'n Script] (http://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_PlugNScript). Audio processing scripts use the angelscript language, and skins the KUIML user interace description language.

You can submit your own scripts and skins for the plug-in, if you want to share them with the community.

Directory Layout:
- Built-in: the factory skins and scripts already included with the plug-in, for reference. Feel free to propose enhancements for these scripts.
